			<h3>Data Visualization: UNT</h3>
			<p>
				We are a team of students interested in describing the current layoff situation.
				Our objectives for this project are to examine the macroeconomic factors that are affecting the 2023 tech layoffs. We would also like to focus on specific geographical areas that we believe are the most affected by the tech layoffs which could be Silicon Valley in California, New York City, and Austin, TX. From our analysis - we can determine specific job functions that are being most affected by the layoffs, experience levels being most affected, and size of companies being most affected. This analysis will allow us to find trends in the data that can identify who is being most affected and why they are being affected by the 2023 tech layoffs.


				As part of our analysis, we would also like to examine the tech sector at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. We can take a look at the unemployment rate, inflation rate, and cost of living in the geographical areas of the tech sector in March 2020 during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This will give us a baseline comparison of the macroeconomic factors in those geographical areas to compare with the macroeconomic factors affecting those areas during the recent 2023 tech layoffs.
